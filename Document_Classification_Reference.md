# Project reference material 

Hi! This is a Markdown file that contains resource for builing up knowledge base for document classification via a machine/deep learning approach. 

 
## Learning Guide
Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning, it is an active research area and has presented the world many models that outperformed human in spefic tasks, such as image recognition and natrual lanuage processing (NLP). To our advantage, state-of-the-art document classification relies on the same two techniques: 
- Image recognition: classifying document types based on the visual features; extracting the textual features from document images (Optical character recognition/OCR)
- NLP: classifying document type based on textual features; classifying (indexing) the extracted textual features.

With this said, having a basic understanding of the two mentioned deep learning domains would be beneficial for the project. I would recommand understanding some machine learning basics first and then go into deep learning for OCR and NLP. The machine learning community is quite big and pretty open-source, you can easily find blog-posts online to build up the foundation. More rigirous material are included below.

### Potential Tools

#### *Lanuages:*
Python is the most supported one in the community. Various other lanuages are also available.

#### *Packages:*
- Tensorflow (deep learning, support many lanuages)
- Pytorch (deep learning, support many lanuages)
- Scikit-learn (machine learning, data processing, support many lanuages)
- fastai (deep learning)
- pytesseract (specifically for OCR)
- NTLK (NLP)
- TextBlob (NLP)
- spaCy (NLP)
- pandas, numpy (data processing, python)

#### *Platforms:*
- AWS SageMaker
- Google Cloud Auto ML
- MS Azure ML
- IBM Watson ML
